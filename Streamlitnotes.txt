      --  move model to other page
      --  Hide model that doesn't work.

- add ability to ask general questions ---> What if I under/overestimates F(coarse, fine, br, dissolved) by X%?
        - e.g. Fcoarse mismeasured
        - e.g. Ffines not representative of Steady state ---> eg. erosion pulse in the past. 
        - can't relly do this in general, bc specific variables contribute to multiple fluxes. 
        - 
-    More specific ---> What if X assumption (specific input variables) were over/underestimated? 

-  Simplify names to match poster// just compare NQT and MT12  (Semi-Arid/Arid)
